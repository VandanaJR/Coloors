Step 1: Generate Random Hex Color.(function geenrateHex)

Step 2: Load the Random Hex Color as background.(function randomColors)

Step 3: Intialize the sliders a/c to the Random Hex Color generated.(function colorizeSliders)

        ->The Hue slider is by default same for all conditions.
        ->The Brightness changes a/c to the Hue. 
          Initialize by using  Hue-Brightness = chroma(randomHexColor).set(hsl.s,value).[Value is number a/c to which brightness varies.]
        ->The Saturation changes a/c to the Brightness of respective Hue. 
          Initialize by using  Hue-Saturation = chroma(Hue-Brightness).set(hsl.l,value).[Value is number a/c to which saturation varies.]

Step 4: Update Hue, Saturation, Brightness a/c to the user inputs.(function updateColor)

        ->Every time the user changes the Hue, Saturation ans Brightness values capture those values and use them to set the HSL values by using functions set(hsl.h,hueDliderValue),
          set(hsl.s,saturationSliderValue), set(hsl.l,brightnessSliderValue) of chroma library.

          After every update style the background colors a/c to the new color obtained.
          [Note: Store the randomHexColor in an array called as initial array and pass it to the updateColor() function to make
          sure that sliders get updated a/c to these initial colors and not based on the black and white colors generated upon changing the brightness and
          saturation values.]

Step 5: Implement the copy to clipboard function as follows:(CREATE & DESTROY)
        ->Create a textarea element
        ->Set the innerText of textarea to that of randomHexColor
        ->Append textarea to body
        ->Select the textarea 
        ->Copy the textarea by .execCommand('copy');
        ->Remove textarea from body
